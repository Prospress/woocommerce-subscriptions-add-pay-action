# WooCommerce Subscriptions - Add Pay Action

Normally, when a subscription needs payment, because its most recent parent, switch or renewal order is pending payment, the Pay button is only displayed against the order needing payment. This requires the subscriber to scroll down to find the pay button.

This plugin add the Pay button to the actions displayed against the subscription on the **My Account > View Subscription** page.
